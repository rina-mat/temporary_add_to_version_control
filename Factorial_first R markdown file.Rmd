```



<b> This is an **R markdown** document where a simple program written in R for calculating factorial is included. </b> 


In this program the variables are -

1. inputfact - That'll be taken from user of which the factorial would be calculated.
2. cnt - loop count
3. Product - calculated and updated in each loop

Finally we get the factorial of a number using this program. 
The R code for this program is attached below.

```{
#Factorial Calculation

inputfact <- readline(prompt = "Insert a number to get the factorial(of the number): ")

cnt <- 2
product <- 1

repeat{
  
  product = product * cnt
  cnt <- cnt+1
  
  
  if (cnt > inputfact){
    break
  }
    
  
}

cat("The factorial of ", inputfact, "is", product)}
summary(cars)
```
